## Rock Alarm 2\.0


</div>

### Description

Sunday evening & I was board until I came up with a great idea! My sister uses my computer & leaves it on all-night when I am out. I thought that I could create a program so I could set a time for my computer to shut down forcefully & automatically. I created this program & that's exactly what the program does. I also added an alarm clock to it... Please vote for my code. I have been coding 4 months...
